#index.html
This is a basic html page. It would serve as a homepage, and contain all the content displayed on the page.
#assets
In the assets folder are the resources that the html will link to, namely the css stylesheet and the javascript source.
#app.js
This file is where the javascript code will go. It is connected to the html page in the head, and it currently only contains some comments about author name and date, as well as a console.log to confirm that it works.
#stylesheet.css
This is a blank stylesheet. Once filled in, the css stylesheet will inform the styling of the html on the index.html page (and any other pages it would link to).
